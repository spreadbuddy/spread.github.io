Moroccan Economic Growth is increasing 
TWB 4/16, Data displayed on this site are a subset of those available in the World Bank’s DataBank, which contains extensive collections of time series data. The DataBank has advanced functions for selecting and slicing the datasets, performing customized queries and data downloads, and creating charts and other visualizations. (“Morocco’s Economic Outlook”) (https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/morocco/publication/economic-outlook-april-2018)KS

GDP growth is projected to decline to 3% in 2018. Cereal production is projected to return to its historical average and non-agricultural GDP growth is expected to remain around 3% in the absence of more decisive structural reforms.
The fiscal deficit is expected to decline to 3.3% of GDP in 2018 in line with the government’s commitment to bring down the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2019-2021 and to reduce public debt to 60% of GDP by 2021. To achieve this target, it would be appropriate for the government to ensure a comprehensive tax reform including measures to reduce tax exemptions, lower corporate tax rates, improve public investment management, and better enforce tax payments by the self-employed and liberal professions. In line with this fiscal consolidation and oil price projections, the current account deficit is projected to remain below 4.5% of GDP in 2018.
Trump is Deterring Migration Now 
Kupoluyi 17,Department of Political Science and Public Administration, Veronica Adeleke School of Social Sciences, College of Management Sciences, Babcock University, Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State, Nigeria. (“Trump Presidency: An Opportunity for Africa to look inward”) (https://search-proquest-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/docview/1932291535/fulltextPDF/3741D556625D4AE7PQ/1?accountid=14667)KS

The victory of Donald Trump‘s emergence was unexpected for many Africans and had been described as ‗an upset‘, based on his many controversial statements, his alleged lack of experience in local, international politics and the perceived insensitivity to the community of immigrants in the US, largely made up of Africans (The Punch, 2016). If media verdict was anything to go by, in winning elections, perhaps, the tide would have turned against Trump, who was described as too blunt to a fault and having little regard for currying public relations‘ advantage and having heavily criticized the media on a number of occasions. The Trump‘s presidency may affect Africans in terms of the fear being nursed that US could turn into a racist country, as we recall that Trump once called for racial profiling, especially of Muslims. Trump supports some unfavorable US immigration policies geared towards a ban of all foreign Muslims from entering the United States. These policies will undoubtedly alienate many ally countries on the continent, of which 30 per cent of Sub-Saharan Africans are Muslims and are predominantly based in North Africa. He recently barred seven Islamic countries from entering the US until the courts upturned the controversial directive. In other statements, he promised: ‗If I become President, we will send them all home. We will build a wall at the Atlantic shore‘ (Trump, 2017), President Trump had manifested this threat recently with the erection of a wall at the Mexican border, which would be paid for by the Mexicans, through the introduction of 20 percent tax on all imports from Mexico, which some African countries trade and have dealings with. Trump had said: …we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world - but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather, to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones - and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth. At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other (Trump, 2017). Adewale K. Kupoluyi, Vol. 14, (Nos. 1 & 2), March/June 2017, pp 67-77 72 Fear of deportation is another major concern for many Africans living in the US. According to the 2006 American Community Survey, Nigeria alone has the greatest number of its people living in America while there are over 250,000 US residents claiming Nigerian heritage and known to be the single largest contemporary African immigrant group in the country. Hence, there is the fear that a Trump could embark on mass deportation and this would affect the migrants. Trump has also vowed to ‗increase standards for the admission of refugees and asylum-seekers‘ (Trump, 2017). In addition to refugees, who are fleeing political, violence, gender and social violence, voluntary immigrants from Africa have accounted for an increasing number of immigrants to the US in recent years. The US has pursued two major foreign policy orientations. It pursued unilateralism and then active engagement within the international system and at different periods that was either neutral or isolationist (Baligidde, 2017). Many Africans enter the US through the diversity visa programme, which seeks to encourage legal immigration from countries other than the major sending-countries of current immigrants to the US; hence, illegal African immigrants may not find it easy any longer to migrate into America. Additionally, such a move may increase tension between the US and African countries that are already retaliating against the perceived inequity of the US‘ immigration system. Trump‘s limitations on legal immigration into his country could lead to isolationist policies that will encourage reciprocity from African countries, as the continent become less open to Americans in retaliation (Robinson, 2016). African countries such as Eritrea, Congo and Sudan are among the top 10 countries seeking US refugee status on a yearly basis, due to citizens fleeing internal crises.

Lifting the cap on skilled immigration leads to unchecked brain drain from Morocco – skilled workers have a very high incentive to migrate to the US.
Abdelhamid 18, Nechad Abdelhamid is a professor of economics at ESCA-EM in Morocco, March 2018, (“A Geo-Economic Approach to Brain Drain in Morocco,” http://www.jesd-online.com/dokumenti/upload/separated/Vol_5_No_1_Paper7.pdf )KS
The incubation of the project to emigrate is often triggered by exogenous factors, the phenomenon being intensified by an international demand for the brain drain. The current globalization plays a paramount role in accelerating this elite migration. The restructuring of the production systems has led to a hike in the demand for highly qualified personnel. And this is sometimes accompanied by aggressive recruitment policies as evidenced by the Green Card in Germany which led to the proliferation of recruitment companies and of websites specialized in “talent hunting”. 
Other exogenous factors of a professional nature encourage this elite to wake up from its latent phase, step up to the plate and emigrate. It is indeed the attractive environment in developed countries characterized by auspicious working and living conditions: a quest for excellence; an organizational flexibility; a competitive spirit; promotion prospects and access to opportunities; sectoral attractions related to the new trades of the new technologies. These professional factors are sustained by others of a rather personal nature: the wage incentives, the promotion systems and the opportunities at hand; the effective social security systems; the possibility to help parents and to be spoilt for choice on children’s schooling. 
Zimmermann (1996) distinguishes between the factors that “push” people out of their countries of origin and the factors that “attract” them to a new “host” country. Some home unfavorable internal conditions are the unsatisfactory educational capacity, the low living standards, the limitations of technology, the inadequate training and employment and the uncertainty of tomorrow, the political malaise, the armed conflicts4 , the absence of realistic labor policies and the economic instability (Chang, 1999). 
The barriers to achieving educational goals or the lack of career opportunities (e.g. due to cuts in the budget allocated to public universities, as is the case in most African countries) can be an “Impulse” towards migration. The establishment of a subsidiary of an international company, or the relocation of factories, is also pushing skilled workers abroad, particularly to the developed world where some IT companies relocate some categories of skilled workers in countries such as India. There is evidence that deteriorating economic conditions are responsible for the brain drain in South Africa (Bhorat et al., 2002). However, for the skilled black South Africans, the feeling of estrangement from the political status quo and the loss of confidence in the government’s ability to improve the living conditions – particularly human rights violations – seem to play an important additional role.
 The factors of attraction include better personal and professional opportunities in the host country, propitious policies for the immigration of the better-educated, wage differentials, differences in the quality of life, education for children, interaction with other professionals, political stability, and job security (Hillman and Weiss 1991, Porés 1991). Countries such as Canada, New Zealand, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom now have aggressive recruitment policies for highly qualified foreigners to increase their own skilled labor force, particularly in a globalized global economy where intellectual worker are highly coveted. 
From an economic perspective, the fundamental motivation for migration is the hope to score a net gain. 4 For example, a number of countries in Africa have experienced serious conflicts over the last 15 to 20 years. These include South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Burundi, Rwanda, Algeria, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. There are at least two potential economic benefits to migration for those participating in the labor market. The first is linked to the gains in the labor market or to income more generally. The second advantage is employment. People can move elsewhere to increase their income in the labor market; migration is then the result of the job search process. They may also move to increase their chances of landing a job, and in this case, migration is an intrinsic part of the job search. 
Skilled Moroccans leave the homeland mainly to work. The working conditions they enjoy in their country of residence are generally better than those offered by their country of origin. Moroccans who emigrate choose to live abroad, but in fact it is their employers who choose them. Indeed, migration for work has always been the choice of the host countries (especially rich countries), since in most cases these countries encourage and accept only people who are sought after in their labor market. These skilled Moroccans abroad have become not only providers of intelligence for their host countries, but also “knowledge workers” in the new globalized order and new actors in international cooperation
